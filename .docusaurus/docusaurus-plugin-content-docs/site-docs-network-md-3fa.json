  "description": "The Bridge Network provides a layer of trust between Bridge Passports and faciliates communication between known passports to create the Bridge Marketplace.  Network and verification partners are vetted and registered with the network as known passports, and bad actor passports are blacklisted to prevent abuse.  Network fees are paid to the network in the form of Bridge Token in exchange for the layer of trust and communication between users and partners.\r",
